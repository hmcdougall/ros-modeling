# Engineering Senior Design Project Fall 23 / Spring 24
Students: Hannah McDougall and Cole Winkhart
Advisor: Jim Leonard

## Project Summery
Our project was to create a simulation of the Miami University ECE self-driving car. This simulation will be physically accurate and should assist in improving the dead reckoning abilities of the car.

## Repository Contents
1. Python Simulation
   This simulation was part of the work completed first semester and was written to help understand ackermann steering, how the car drives, and speed and turn angle commands.
2. Gazebo Simulation
   This  simulation utulizes Gazebo, ROS, and an [ackermann vehicle plugin](https://github.com/hdh7485/ackermann_vehicle/tree/noetic). The software utulizes a physics pakage to simulate more realistic movement of the Miami car.

Instructions to run both simulations should be found in the README.md located in each folder, respectively.
